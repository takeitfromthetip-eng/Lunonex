# ForTheWeebs Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 2025**

---

## 🛡️ OUR CORE PROMISE: WE NEVER SELL YOUR DATA

**Let's be crystal clear from the jump:** ForTheWeebs does not sell, rent, lease, trade, or monetize your personal information. We don't traffic your data to advertisers, data brokers, marketers, or anyone else. Ever.

We believe selling user data is exploitative and disgusting. We built this platform to connect creators and fans directly, not to harvest your information for corporate profit. **Your data is YOURS, not ours.**

This isn't just a policy—it's encoded into our infrastructure. We've built technical safeguards to block any attempts to export or sell user data. If anyone tries to change this, the system will literally refuse to execute.
