- [ ] Redis caching for templates?
- [ ] Rate limiting on AI endpoints?

### Features:
- [ ] PSD import/export edge cases
- [ ] Comic panel generator output quality
- [ ] Template marketplace UI/UX
- [ ] Influencer verification flow

### Missing from Roadmap:
- [ ] Frame animation (After Effects killer)
- [ ] Real-time audio collaboration
- [ ] VST plugin hosting
- [ ] Social graph builder
- [ ] VR physics engine
- [ ] AI pose generator
- [ ] Mobile UI optimizer

## 💡 Core Philosophy

### For Users:
**"Pay once. Create forever."**

No subscriptions (except $15/mo adult content). No per-seat pricing. No surprise charges. One payment unlocks everything.

### For Creators:
**"70% is yours. Always."**

We take 30% platform fee on marketplace sales. You keep 70%. No hidden fees. Instant payouts.

### For Competitors:
**"Adapt or die."**

We're not playing nice. We're offering 10 years of their tools for 1% of their price. They either match us or lose.

### For Influencers:
**"You talk, we pay."**

25 influencers get free $500 unlocks because they'll tell the world. That's worth more than any ad spend.
