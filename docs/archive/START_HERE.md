## 💡 **Key Insights**

### **1. The Platform is Proof**
Don't think of content creators as the goal. They're proof your tech works. Bug data from creators proves to government that self-healing works.

### **2. Dual-Use is Powerful**
- Commercial revenue pays bills
- Government contracts scale revenue
- Reduces risk for investors
- Validates technology in production

### **3. Move Fast in Government Space**
Government moves slow. Build fast, prove it works, and be ready when they finally come around.

### **4. Network > Cold Outreach**
Government contracts come from relationships, not cold emails. Attend events, join communities, build trust.

### **5. Certifications Matter**
CMMC, FedRAMP, SOC 2 aren't optional. Budget for them early.

---

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

### **1. Waiting for Government**
❌ Don't wait for gov contracts to launch
✅ Launch commercial first, then approach government

### **2. Over-Engineering**
❌ Don't build every feature before launch
✅ Ship MVP, iterate based on user feedback

### **3. Ignoring Compliance**
❌ Don't defer compliance "until later"
✅ Build it in from day one (you already have)

### **4. Solo Development**
❌ Don't try to do everything alone
✅ Hire experts (CMMC consultant, defense sales, etc.)

### **5. Burning Out**
❌ Don't work 100 hours/week
✅ Sustainable pace wins the marathon

---

## 🎯 **Decision Framework**

**When evaluating opportunities, ask:**

1. **Does this prove the tech?**
   - If yes → Priority
   - If no → Defer

2. **Does this generate data?**
   - More users = more bugs = more proof
   - Prioritize things that scale data

3. **Does this advance government goals?**
   - Will it help with SBIR?
   - Will it help with contracts?
   - If yes → Make time for it

4. **Is this sustainable?**
   - Can you maintain this pace?
   - Will you burn out?
   - If no → Slow down
